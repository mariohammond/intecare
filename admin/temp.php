            <br/><br/>
            <p>You have been randomly selected for the MHFRP time study this quarter. Participation in both the training and the time study is mandatory.</p>
            <p><a href='http://www.intecareapp.com/training?id=$emp[3]'>Please click here to begin training</a>.</p>
            <p>You may quit and return to the training at any point in the process. The system will save your place. Once you have completed the training, you can access the system for review prior to the time study week by clicking the link above. If you want to print the training to use as a reference there will be a link to a PDF document for quick printing at the end of the training or go to our <a href='http://www.intecare.org/mhfrp'>website</a>.</p>
            <p>You must pass all three quizzes before your score is recorded. Once you reach the last page that contains our program\'s toll-free number in red, your training is complete and your score has been recorded. You will not receive further confirmation and you can exit the system at that point.
            <p>Please be sure to complete the training during the period of May 11th - May 22nd.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions regarding the training, process, the time study, or if you are not the person named above, please contact Intecare using the link below.</p>
